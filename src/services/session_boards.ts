/**
 * Slice E — the board pick. The pre-board session surface.
 *
 * 🔑 THE CHICKEN-AND-EGG THIS EXISTS TO BREAK. Every other read in this app is
 * board-scoped: `authedProcedure` (init.ts) rejects any call whose `x-board`
 * header is missing or unknown, and the grade chips a student picks from are
 * themselves board-scoped (`listGradeOptions` reads `subject`, which is
 * FORCE-RLS'd). So a brand-new student cannot be shown grades until they have
 * committed to a board — and cannot commit to a board through any procedure
 * that already requires one. These four reads are the only ones in the codebase
 * that run WITHOUT a board, and they are deliberately tiny.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY MEMBERSHIP READ HERE ITERATES BOARDS UNDER withBoard. `membership`
 * is FORCE-RLS'd, so a board-less select returns ZERO rows and reads as
 * "this person belongs nowhere" — the spurious clean answer this codebase has
 * been bitten by repeatedly (see b2c-two-user-tables). The loop costs one
 * transaction per board and there are TWO boards. That is the price of not
 * punching an RLS hole, and it is the right price: a policy exception here
 * would be a permanent tenant-isolation weakness bought to save one query.
 * DO NOT "optimise" this into a board-less read or a policy carve-out.

/**
 * The boards a student may actually pick — those with something to LEARN.
 *
 * 🔴 THE TEST IS PUBLISHED SLIDES, NOT A `subject` ROW. The first cut of this
 * checked `subject`, on the reasoning that a board with no grades strands the
 * student on `— no classes set up yet —`. The browser walk showed what that
 * actually returns against a real database: **46 boards**, because "insert one
 * subject" is a single line every probe writes, and the picker offered a child
 * "Fig P", "Probe Q" and "Probe T". Measured on the dev DB: 76 boards exist,
 * 46 have a subject, and exactly **2** have published slides — cbse and
 * cambridge, the two real ones.
 *
 * Published slides is also the RIGHT rule, not merely a stricter one. The dead
 * end that matters is not "no grades", it is "no lessons": a board with a full
 * grade list and nothing published drops the student on a dashboard where every
 * "Start lesson" 404s. This is the same signal `getChapterNav.hasContent` uses
 * to aim the first-run CTA (S108) — one concept, two call sites, not a new one.
 *
 * ⚠️ CONSEQUENCE, worth knowing before content moves: a board is only pickable
 * while it has ≥1 published chapter. If cbse's single published chapter were
 * ever unpublished, cbse would vanish from the picker rather than offer an
 * empty product. That is deliberate, but it means the picker is now downstream
 * of content publishing.
 *
 * `content_unit` is RLS'd, hence the per-board withBoard (see the file header).

/**
 * 🔑 Slice M (founder) — THE OFFERED BOARDS ARE A PRODUCT DECISION, not a query
 * result. This **supersedes the published-slides rule documented above**, which
 * is kept verbatim because its reasoning still explains the two failure modes
 * this list has to keep avoiding.
 *
 * What changed and why: the derived rule made the picker downstream of content
 * publishing (its own ⚠️ said so). The founder wants the three boards we intend
 * to serve — CBSE, IGCSE, Cambridge — visible now, and a board with nothing
 * behind it to land the student on the "still setting this up" screen rather
 * than hide. That is a strictly better dead end than the derived rule's, which
 * was to make the board VANISH: a child told "we're setting it up" knows the
 * app works and their board is coming; a child who cannot find their board at
 * all concludes the product is not for them.
 *
 * 🔴 The old rule's real win is preserved. It existed because a `subject`-based
 * check offered a child "Fig P", "Probe Q" and "Probe T" — 46 boards, mostly
 * probe litter. An explicit allow-list cannot regress into that no matter what
 * any probe inserts, which is a stronger guarantee than the content check was.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY SLUG HERE MUST EXIST IN `board`. `chooseBoard` throws BoardNotFound
 * on a miss, so an unseeded slug is a crash on the student's first tap, not an
 * empty product. `bun run seed:boards` creates them and is the sibling of this
 * list — see `scripts/seed_boards.ts`.
 *
 * Order is the order the chips render.
